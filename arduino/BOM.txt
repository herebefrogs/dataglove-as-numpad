- 5 pieces of conductive fabric 0.5in x 1~1.5in (e.g. https://www.creatroninc.com/product/conductive-fabric-14x12/)
- 5 electric wires about ~3ft long (depending how far the glove will be from the Arduino board)
- (optional) 5 male pin headers (to connect the wires more easily to the Arduino pins)
- 1 glove
- 1 electric iron
- 1 glue gun or 1 soldering iron
